# Suna Space Beans Playground

**A physics sandbox where you can fling beans at stuff. lol.**
*Yeah, you can spawn this many. Go on, crash your PC. It's funny.*

---

## About This Thing

So yeah, I was bored and made this.

It's basically one of those old physics toys from the Flash game era. You get a screen, and you can fill it with beans. That's it. There's no point. No score. Just you and a growing pile of beautiful chaos. Have at it.

## Features

* **Spawn All the Beans:** Just keep clicking the spawn button. Your computer's only limit is how much you're willing to make it suffer. It's a feature, not a bug.
* **Yeet The Beans:** Grab any bean and just throw it. See what happens. That's the whole gameplay loop, lol.
* **Make 'Em Spin:** Right-drag a bean to make it spin really, really fast. Why? No reason. It just looks funny.
* **The Nuke Button:** The "Clear" button deletes everything. Good for when the lag gets too real, or you just want a fresh canvas for your mess.
* **No Rules, For Real:** Do whatever you want. Make piles. Try to spell your name. It's your playground.

## Controls

It's not complicated.

| Action             | How to do it         |

## Credits

This game would literally be a bunch of boring circles without the art from [**SunaMoon**](https://www.deviantart.com/sunamoonmlp). All credit for the cool-looking beans goes to them, so go check out their stuff.

Made because I had nothing better to do. Hope you have some pointless fun with it.
